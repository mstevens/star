This directory is for building the Windows installer for Rakudo Star.

You will need
- Strawberry Perl (eg. the one that comes with Padre from 
      http://padre.perlide.org/download.html ) 
	  padre-0.84-on-strawberry-5.12.3.0-v3.exe
- Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
      5.4.2(a)

Download The source distribution of Rakudo Star from https://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads
ptar -xzf rakudo-star-2011.04.tar.gz
cd rakudo-star-2011.04

As currently the executable is not relocatable we need to decide
which directory to install. Currently it is c:\rakudo

Follow the insturctions in the README of Rakudo Star:

> perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot --prefix c:\rakudo
> gmake
> gmake install

Manually copy c:\strawberry\c\bin\libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll to c:\rakudo\bin

Create a directory called c:\output where the resulting executable will be placed.
Then start the Inno Setup Compiler and open the rakudo.iss file.
Change the "AppVersion" field.

Click on    "Build/Compile"

This should generate c:\output\rakudo-star.exe
